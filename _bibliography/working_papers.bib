title = {Direction is more important than speed: A comparison of direction and value prediction of stock returns},
author = {Cheng, Tingting and Shang, Yitong and Zhao, Albert Bo},
abstract = {A major research task in asset pricing is predicting the value of future stock returns. We examine a seemingly simpler and yet less explored task—predicting the direction of future stock returns. Theoretically, a simple model in Christoffersen and Diebold (2006) suggests that direction prediction is closely related to the widely recognized volatility clustering effect. Empirically, we compare direction and value prediction of the S&P500 excess returns via a variety of models, including linear, regularized linear, machine learning, and combination methods. The general findings indicate that for a typical investor, direction prediction generates greater economic gains than value prediction does because of the information embedded in volatility and higher moments of returns. From the models’ perspectives, while machine learning and combination methods can enhance both direction and value prediction, the enhancement is more significant in the realm of direction prediction, and the predictive power stems from the volatility mechanism. Additional analyses suggest that value and direction prediction share similar stock market risk factors.},

  abstract = {We propose a simple, linear-regression-based method for prediction of the time series of stock returns. The method achieves out-of-sample performances comparable to machine learning methods while having ignorable computational costs. The key component of the method is to integrate a straightforward cross-market factor screening into the iterated combination method proposed by Lin, Wu, and Zhou (2018). Our empirical results on the U.S. stock market show that the method outperforms many state-of-the-art machine learning methods in certain periods. The method also exhibits greater utility gain and investment profits in most periods after considering transaction costs.},

author = {Li, Sheng and Xu, Chenggang and Zhao, Albert Bo},
abstract = {This paper provides evidence that the U.S. Securities Acts of 1933 and 1934 improved market stability by imposing mandatory information disclosure. Despite being the world's first national level financial regulation laws, the seminal Acts' effects have remained controversial. We argue that improvement of accounting report and mandatory disclosure of insiders' holdings help reduce the volatility of security returns. We provide evidence that reductions in NYSE stocks' idiosyncratic volatility and market volatility are causally related to enforcement of the Acts. Overall, our evidence shows one positive effect of the initial introduction of mandatory disclosure by the 1933/34 Acts.},

author = {Cheng, Tingting and Jiang, Shan and Lin, Hai and Wu, Chunchi and Zhao, Albert Bo},
selected={false},
abstract={Using predictors from corporate bond, Treasury, and stock markets, we find that corporate bond returns are predictable based on an ensemble learning approach, ``Stacking''.  Combining various linear and nonlinear models together, we show that Stacking generates significant predictive power in terms of both statistical measure and economic gain across bond ratings and maturities. Long term government bond return, leverage ratio, default return spread, and stock liquidity are the most critical factors in corporate bond return prediction. We also find that a simpler meta model performs best.}
