title = {Direction is more important than speed: A comparison of direction and value prediction of stock returns},
author = {Cheng, Tingting and Shang, Yitong and Zhao, Albert Bo},
abstract = {A major research topic in asset pricing is predicting the value of stock excess returns. We examine a seemingly simpler and yet less explored problemâ€”--predicting the direction. Using established predictors from value prediction literature, we compare linear, regularized linear, machine learning, and combination models across both tasks. Models achieve higher accuracy when shifting from value to direction prediction, yielding greater economic gains. Consistent with value prediction literature, machine learning and combination methods generally outperform simpler models. While volatility clustering provides an intuitive rationale for direction predictability, adding diverse predictors markedly boosts performance. However, direction prediction with a limited set of volatility-related predictors can still compete with value prediction using a comprehensive set of predictors. Furthermore, blending value and direction strategies outperform value strategies alone, but fall short of direction-only results. We also find that direction strategies can explain the returns of value strategies, but not vice versa.},

title = {Does Securities Regulation Matter? Mandatory Disclosure, Excess Stock Volatility and the U.S. 1934 Securities Exchange Act},
author = {Li, Sheng and Xu, Chenggang and Zhao, Albert Bo},
abstract = {We examine whether the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934 significantly stabilized the market by introducing mandatory disclosure of information. We argue that mandatory information disclosure can curb stock manipulation by enhancing transparency, thereby reducing excess stock volatility. After a comprehensive assessment of the voluntary disclosure practices of NYSE-listed companies before 1934, we group the companies and find that those with poor disclosure practices experienced a significantly greater reduction in volatility after the implementation of the 1934 Act compared to those with good disclosure practices. Further analysis reveals that the liquidity of these poorly disclosing companies also improved significantly more than that of the better disclosing companies, and the improvement in liquidity was linked to the decrease in their volatility. Given that one of the key intentions of the legislators was to reduce excess market volatility through the Act, our findings provide empirical support for this legislative intent.},

title = {Corporate Bond Return Prediction: An Ensemble Learning Approach},
author = {Cheng, Tingting and Jiang, Shan and Lin, Hai and Wu, Chunchi and Zhao, Albert Bo},
selected={false},
abstract={Using predictors from corporate bond, Treasury, and stock markets, we find that corporate bond returns are predictable based on an ensemble learning approach, ``Stacking''.  Combining various linear and nonlinear models together, we show that Stacking generates significant predictive power in terms of both statistical measure and economic gain across bond ratings and maturities. Long term government bond return, leverage ratio, default return spread, and stock liquidity are the most critical factors in corporate bond return prediction. We also find that a simpler meta model performs best.}
