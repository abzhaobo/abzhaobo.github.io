title = {Direction is more important than speed: A comparison of direction and value prediction of stock returns},
author = {Cheng, Tingting and Shang, Yitong and Zhao, Albert Bo},
abstract = {A major research task in asset pricing is predicting the value of future stock returns. We examine a seemingly simpler and yet less explored task—predicting the direction of future stock returns. Theoretically, a simple model in Christoffersen and Diebold (2006) suggests that direction prediction is closely related to the widely recognized volatility clustering effect. Empirically, we compare direction and value prediction of the S&P500 excess returns via a variety of models, including linear, regularized linear, machine learning, and combination methods. The general findings indicate that for a typical investor, direction prediction generates greater economic gains than value prediction does because of the information embedded in volatility and higher moments of returns. From the models’ perspectives, while machine learning and combination methods can enhance both direction and value prediction, the enhancement is more significant in the realm of direction prediction, and the predictive power stems from the volatility mechanism. Additional analyses suggest that value and direction prediction share similar stock market risk factors.},

title = {Does Securities Regulation Matter? Mandatory Disclosure, Excess Stock Volatility and the U.S. 1934 Securities Exchange Act},
author = {Li, Sheng and Xu, Chenggang and Zhao, Albert Bo},
abstract = {We examine whether the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934 significantly stabilized the market by introducing mandatory disclosure of information. We argue that mandatory information disclosure can curb stock manipulation by enhancing transparency, thereby reducing excess stock volatility. After a comprehensive assessment of the voluntary disclosure practices of NYSE-listed companies before 1934, we group the companies and find that those with poor disclosure practices experienced a significantly greater reduction in volatility after the implementation of the 1934 Act compared to those with good disclosure practices. Further analysis reveals that the liquidity of these poorly disclosing companies also improved significantly more than that of the better disclosing companies, and the improvement in liquidity was linked to the decrease in their volatility. Given that one of the key intentions of the legislators was to reduce excess market volatility through the Act, our findings provide empirical support for this legislative intent.},

title = {Corporate Bond Return Prediction: An Ensemble Learning Approach},
author = {Cheng, Tingting and Jiang, Shan and Lin, Hai and Wu, Chunchi and Zhao, Albert Bo},
selected={false},
abstract={Using predictors from corporate bond, Treasury, and stock markets, we find that corporate bond returns are predictable based on an ensemble learning approach, ``Stacking''.  Combining various linear and nonlinear models together, we show that Stacking generates significant predictive power in terms of both statistical measure and economic gain across bond ratings and maturities. Long term government bond return, leverage ratio, default return spread, and stock liquidity are the most critical factors in corporate bond return prediction. We also find that a simpler meta model performs best.}
