title = {Predicting the Predictable: Decomposing and Forecasting Stock Returns in a Data-rich Environment},
author = {Cheng, Tingting and Xuanbin Yang and Zhao, Albert Bo},
abstract = {We propose a new method for forecasting stock market returns in a data-rich environment: the factor-augmented sum-of-the-parts (FA-SOP) approach. Rather than predicting returns directly, FA-SOP decomposes them into three components—dividend-price ratio, earnings growth, and price-earnings ratio growth (gm)—and models each separately. We emphasize that gm is a more promising target for forecasting due to its stronger connection with macroeconomic conditions and greater variability over time. FA-SOP forecasts gm using latent macroeconomic factors extracted from high-dimensional data, capturing the underlying state of the economy while avoiding overfitting. Applied to S&P 500 returns from 1960 to 2022, FA-SOP outperforms predictive regressions, factor-augmented regressions, and traditional decomposition approaches, yielding robust out-ofsample gains in both statistical and economic terms. Simulations based on a present-value model further show that FA-SOP’s advantage stems from its ability to track the true data-generating process more closely. Our results highlight the value of decomposing returns and focusing on components that are more predictably linked to economic fundamentals.},

mytake = {Rather than treating return predictability as an all-or-nothing property, we argue that stock returns consist of both more predictable and less predictable components. Disentangling these components and analyzing them separately provides a clearer understanding of where and how predictability arises. For components with inherently low signal-to-noise ratios, a passive approach---such as using the HM---is sufficient. But for components with clearer economic meaning or stronger signals, more active and structured modeling could uncover substantial predictive value. This targeted approach allows us to focus modeling effort where it matters most, and avoid overfitting where little can be gained.}

@article{direction,
title = {Direction is more important than speed: A comparison of direction and value prediction of stock returns},
author = {Cheng, Tingting and Shang, Yitong and Zhao, Albert Bo},
abstract = {A major research topic in asset pricing is predicting the value of stock excess returns. We examine a seemingly simpler and yet less explored problem—--predicting the direction. Theoretically, mechanisms such as the Campbell-Shiller identity and volatility clustering can support direction predictability. Using various established predictors from value prediction literature, we compare linear, regularized linear, machine learning, and combination models across both tasks. When shifting from value to direction prediction, models achieve higher accuracy and yield greater economic gains, mainly because of their stronger ability to predict market downturns. Consistent with the value prediction literature, machine learning and combination methods generally outperform simpler models in direction prediction as well. While most models perform better when incorporating the full set of predictors, direction prediction with a limited set of predictors can still rival value prediction using a comprehensive set of predictors. Moreover, blending value and direction strategies outperforms value strategies but does not surpass direction-only results. We also find that the returns of direction strategies can explain the returns of value strategies, but not vice versa.},

mytake = {It seems that predicting the *value* of future stock returns has been an orthodox practice in the field of asset pricing since at least Sharpe (1964) and Ross (1976). The beautiful theory of factor model provides both explanatory and predictive implications for statistical exercises, inspiring a voluminous body of empirical literature. However, an often encountered layperson's first question, while not naive, is: ``Do you think the market will go up (bullish) or down (bearish) in the near future?''. In this paper we examine this question through the lens of empirical asset pricing and machine learning.}

title = {Corporate Bond Return Prediction: An Ensemble Learning Approach},

selected={false},
abstract={Using an ensemble machine learning method ``Stacking'' to forecast returns, we find that corporate bond returns can be predicted by a comprehensive set of predictors from corporate bond, Treasury, and stock markets. By introducing new features into combination forecasts, the Stacking method increases the power of the predictive model and generates higher statistical and economic gains across bond ratings and maturities. The method is efficient for tackling high dimensionality and achieves the best result when using all predictors jointly. While the overall performance of different Stacking models is satisfactory, simpler Stacking models appear to outperform others and generate optimal forecasts.},
mytake = {Combination is still what we need in return prediction. Stacking, the general framework of combination, reinforces my belief.}
