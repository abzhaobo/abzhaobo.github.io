abstract = {A major research topic in asset pricing is predicting the value of stock excess returns. We examine a seemingly simpler and yet less explored problemâ€”--predicting the direction. Theoretically, mechanisms such as the Campbell-Shiller identity and volatility clustering can support direction predictability. Using various established predictors from value prediction literature, we compare linear, regularized linear, machine learning, and combination models across both tasks. When shifting from value to direction prediction, models achieve higher accuracy and yield greater economic gains, mainly because of their stronger ability to predict market downturns. Consistent with the value prediction literature, machine learning and combination methods generally outperform simpler models in direction prediction as well. While most models perform better when incorporating the full set of predictors, direction prediction with a limited set of predictors can still rival value prediction using a comprehensive set of predictors. Moreover, blending value and direction strategies outperforms value strategies but does not surpass direction-only results. We also find that the returns of direction strategies can explain the returns of value strategies, but not vice versa.},

mytake = {It seems that predicting the *value* of future stock returns has been an orthodox practice in the field of asset pricing since at least Sharpe (1964) and Ross (1976). The beautiful theory of factor model provides both explanatory and predictive implications for statistical exercises, inspiring a voluminous body of empirical literature. However, an often encountered layperson's first question, while not naive, is: ``Do you think the market will go up or down in the near future?''. In this paper we examine this question through the lens of empirical asset pricing and machine learning.}

title = {Does Securities Regulation Matter? Mandatory Disclosure, Excess Stock Volatility and the U.S. 1934 Securities Exchange Act},
author = {Li, Sheng and Xu, Chenggang and Zhao, Albert Bo},
abstract = {We examine whether the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934 significantly stabilized the market by introducing mandatory disclosure of information. We argue that mandatory information disclosure can curb stock manipulation by enhancing transparency, thereby reducing excess stock volatility. After a comprehensive assessment of the voluntary disclosure practices of NYSE-listed companies before 1934, we group the companies and find that those with poor disclosure practices experienced a significantly greater reduction in volatility after the implementation of the 1934 Act compared to those with good disclosure practices. Further analysis reveals that the liquidity of these poorly disclosing companies also improved significantly more than that of the better disclosing companies, and the improvement in liquidity was linked to the decrease in their volatility. Given that one of the key intentions of the legislators was to reduce excess market volatility through the Act, our findings provide empirical support for this legislative intent.},

abstract={Using predictors from corporate bond, Treasury, and stock markets, we find that corporate bond returns are predictable based on an ensemble learning approach, ``Stacking''.  Combining various linear and nonlinear models together, we show that Stacking generates significant predictive power in terms of both statistical measure and economic gain across bond ratings and maturities. Long term government bond return, leverage ratio, default return spread, and stock liquidity are the most critical factors in corporate bond return prediction. We also find that a simpler meta model performs best.}
