abstract = {This paper provides evidence that the U.S. Securities Acts of 1933 and 1934 improved market stability by imposing mandatory information disclosure. Despite being the world's first national level financial regulation laws, the seminal Acts' effects have remained controversial. We argue that improvement of accounting report and mandatory disclosure of insiders' holdings help reduce the volatility of security returns. We provide evidence that reductions in NYSE stocks' idiosyncratic volatility and market volatility are causally related to enforcement of the Acts. Overall, our evidence shows one positive effect of the initial introduction of mandatory disclosure by the 1933/34 Acts.},

abstract={Using predictors from corporate bond, Treasury, and stock markets, we find that corporate bond returns are predictable based on an ensemble learning approach, ``Stacking''.  Combining various linear and nonlinear models together, we show that Stacking generates significant predictive power in terms of both statistical measure and economic gain across bond ratings and maturities. Long term government bond return, leverage ratio, default return spread, and stock liquidity are the most critical factors in corporate bond return prediction. We also find that a simpler meta model performs best.}
