#### <u>The Name Dilemma</u>

In daily life, I go by _Bo Zhao_. But when publishing academic papers, I use _Albert Bo Zhao_&mdash;mostly to avoid an identity crisis. You see, the economics and finance world is already packed with heavyweight Bo Zhaos. There's Bo Zhao at the **Boston Fed** ([link](https://www.bostonfed.org/people/bank/bo-zhao.aspx)), Bo Zhao at **PKU** ([link](https://en.nsd.pku.edu.cn/faculty/fulltime/z/239574.htm)), and Bo Zhao at the **IMF** ([link](https://development.asia/expert/bo-zhao)). 

As a result, I used to get misdirected emails sometimes. So, to make life easier, I publish as Albert Bo Zhao (my friends call me 阿博 (A-Bo)&mdash;so Albert just felt like a natural choice). But don't worry&mdash;if you're emailing me about lunch plans, Bo is just fine.

Fun fact: The IMF's Bo Zhao and I not only share the same name but also the same undergraduate alma mater. When we overlapped at HKU, we've joked that we had quite the presence&mdash;at least on paper.
